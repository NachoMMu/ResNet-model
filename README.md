# ResNet-model
Project developed in Python in collaboration with Dr. Pedro Escarate from PUCV. ResNet model trained on synthetic spectra from the "Isosceles Grid" database to predict rotational velocity in massive stars, aiming to achieve similar or better results than those obtained in Piacob-broad and IACOB-broad when analyzing real stars.
